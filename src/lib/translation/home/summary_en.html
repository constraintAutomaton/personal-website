I'm a PhD student in computer science, currently researching decentralized querying. I'm also very
interested in logic programming (mainly Prolog ðŸ™‚) and functional programming. You can find most of
my work on <a href="https://github.com/constraintAutomaton" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The source
code of this website is
